# Extension of NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_lpr_app
This is a sample of using GPIO pins on Jetson Nano to support car nearby detection and ambient light detection. If a vehicle is close to the system, the ultrasonic sensor will trigger the ambient light detection to determine whether additional illuminiation system is needed. Once all the pre-detection are done. A five second video will be recorded either by a CSI camera or a USB camera. After that, the main program provided by deepstream_lpr_app will be used to recognize the vehicle and the license plate.

## Description
This sample is to show how to use graded models for detection and classification with DeepStream SDK version not less than 5.0.1. The models in this sample are all TLT3.0 models.

`PGIE(car detection) -> SGIE(car license plate detection) -> SGIE(car license plate recognization)`

![LPR/LPD application](lpr.png)

This pipeline is based on three TLT models below

* Car detection model https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:tlt_trafficcamnet
* LPD (car license plate detection) model https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:tlt_lpdnet
* LPR (car license plate recognization/text extraction) model https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:tlt_lprnet

More details for TLT3.0 LPD and LPR models and TLT training, please refer to [TLT document](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/TLT/tlt-getting-started-guide/).
